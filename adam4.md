I've been tracking some of the privacy and metadata issues a little in my work as a privacy law research assistant. I wasn't too surprised by the holding in Riley. The Fourth Amendment is kind of a double-edged sword. It is weak in that it provides very little ultimate protection against a search of just about any kind. If law enforcement agents meet the low bar of probable cause and obtain a warrant from a magistrate, they can search just about anything. (Even in Jones, the 2012 GPS case, the Supreme Court went back to a physical trespass theory to find a Fourth Amendment violation. The GPS itself was not necessarily a problem, and the police actually had gotten a warrant to attach the GPS device and carry out extended surveillance.) On the other hand, the probable cause and warrant requirements make it easy for the courts to find a Fourth Amendment search. The very fact that warrants and probable cause are relatively easy to obtain gives the courts a lot of room to apply the Fourth Amendment when police do what they did in Riley. Interestingly, the Suprreme Court of Canada said just the opposite this year. In R. v. Fearon, 2014 SCC 77, the Supreme Court of Canada held that police may search cell phones without a warrant incident to an arrest. 

Given that, for now, law enforcement will have to get a warrant before digging into your cell phone data, it will be interesting to see how the mosaic theory evolves. Given the exponential advances we are seeing in data collection, storage, and linking, it seems only natural that something like the mosaic theory will ultimately prevail. But, will it matter? If the probable cause/warrant requirements are so easily met anyway, how will an aggregate search be any different? If law enforcement can establish probable cause, then all they will need to do is sufficiently describe, in advance, which parts of the mosaic they want to search/obtain. In that case, the mosaic theory won't do much more than maybe alter some law enforcement investigative techniques. There will be a handful of cases of first impression where defendants will benefit from the theory (like Riley in the case of cell phone searches incident to arrest), but I don't expect to see case after case where the courts are pointing to this theory to stop the government from obtaining data and metadata from cell phones and a variety of other sources. 

I've actually heard very little about differential privacy, but right now it seems to be the only practical theory for protecting privacy in light of the reach of big data. I agree with Bambauer et al.'s assessment that differential privacy would basically destroy data utility in a research context due to accuracy problems, but I don't think that means it can't be useful in legal context. For example, the use of differential privacy methods, even when they fail, might satisfy the legal standards for privacy and data protection required under the Privacy Act or the E-Government Act, which apply to government-held databases.
